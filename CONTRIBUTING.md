# How to Contribute to Protocol Fourier

> Welcome to the Colmena Cuántica scientific community. We thrive on precision, rigor, and entropy.

## The Prime Directive
**All contributions must increase the fitness of the swarm.**

## Scientific Standards
1.  **Mathematical Rigor**: Any PR changing the core math (`src/math_kernel`) must be accompanied by a LaTex proof or a reference paper.
2.  **Bio-Mimicry**: Features should mimic biological processes (e.g., "Hibernation", "Metabolism", "Mutation").
3.  **Zero-Touch Philosophy**: The system must run autonomously indefinitely. Avoid human-in-the-loop dependencies.

## Development Workflow
1.  **Clone the Lab**: `git clone`
2.  **Create a Hypothesis**: `git checkout -b hypothesis-new-activation-func`
3.  **Run Experiments**: `python test_gym_fractal.py`
4.  **Publish Findings**: Open a PR with a description of the observed PnL impact.

## Style Guide
- **Python**: PEP8 Strict.
- **Tensors**: Annotate shapes in comments. Example: `# [Batch, Time, Feats]`
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, biological variable names (`genome`, `population`, `generation`).
